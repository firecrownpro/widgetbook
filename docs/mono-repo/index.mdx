# MonoRepo

A lot of app projects implement dedicated packages for UI components. These
packages often do not define a (desktop) app. Therefore, it's hard to use
Widgetbook for these packages. This section will explain how you can get
Widgetbook running in such a scenario.

Let's assume you have set up a monorepo with the following folder structure with
two packages `ui_components` and `core_api`:

```
monorepo
├─ docs
├─ packages
│  ├─ ui_components
│  ├─ core_api
```

To create a widgetbook for the `ui_components` package, we recommend to create a
new folder named `widgetbooks` in the root of the repository and add a flutter
(desktop) app named `ui_components_widgetbook`. The folder structure of your
repository will look like this:

```
monorepo
├─ docs
├─ packages
│  ├─ ui_components
│  ├─ core_api
├─ widgetbooks
│  ├─ ui_components_widgetbook
│  │  ├─ lib
│  │  ├─ macos
│  │  ├─ pubspec.yaml
```

Make sure to modify `widgetbooks/ui_components_widgetbook/pubspec.yaml` to
depend on `ui_components`:

`pubspec.yaml:`

```
dependencies:
  ui_components:
    path: ../../packages/ui_components
```

You can now use all exported `Widget`s from your library to compose your
Widgetbook.
