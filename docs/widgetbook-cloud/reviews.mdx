# Widgetbook Cloud Review

<Warning>
  Widgetbook Cloud Review currently works with **GitHub only**. We are planning
  to add more Git providers in the future.
</Warning>

Widgetbook Cloud Review has two main features that can help you improve your development workflow:

1. [**UI Regression Detection**](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#ui-regression-detection): to automatically detect UI regressions.
1. [**Figma x Flutter Comparison**](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#figma-x-flutter-comparison): to verify if the developer meets the design requirements.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Connect** your Widgetbook Project to a **GitHub repo** from the project settings page.
1. Make sure to you have a [Widgetbook Build](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting) on pushes of new commits [via CI](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#pushing-new-builds-with-ci) (e.g. GitHub Actions).

## UI Regression Detection

Widgetbook Cloud provides a zero-config UI regression detection system. It automatically compares the visual differences between different builds and highlights the changes in the UI.

It works similarly like GitHub PRs. Instead of only comparing code changes, with Widgetbook Cloud Reviews, you can now also compare visual differences and detect **UI regressions** between different branches or commits.

| GitHub PRs                                                       | Widgetbook Cloud Reviews                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compare **code changes** between `base` commit and `head` commit | Compare **visual differences** between `base` build and `head` build |

### Guide

1. Finish the [pre-requisites](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews#pre-requisites) set up.
1. Create a new branch (e.g. `feat/new-button`) and commit your changes to it.
1. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your `head` branch (e.g. `feat/new-button`) to the `base` branch (e.g. `main`).
1. After your build upload finishes (i.e. the CI job from [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)), a [commit status](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) will be added to your PR once the review is ready.

### Reviewing

After your review is ready, you can start comparing the visual differences between the `base` and `head` builds. Here are some things that can help improving your workflow:

1. **Validate** if your visual changes are intentional or not.
2. **Ask team mates for review** if all changes were intentional.
3. **Provide feedback** by copying the link to the Widgetbook Cloud Review Story and leaving a comment in the GitHub PR.

<Info>
  If the reviewer doesn't have access to GitHub _(e.g. a designer)_, we suggest
  using messaging tools _(e.g. Slack)_. Please [reach
  out](https://discord.com/invite/zT4AMStAJA) to us in case this doesn't suit
  you and you want to use a dedicated comment feature in Widgetbook Cloud.

### Review Statuses

| Status   | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open     | Awaiting assessment.                                    |
| Merged   | Linked with merged PRs, thus considered merged.         |
| Closed   | Associated with closed PRs, hence viewed as closed.     |
| Updating | Missing crucial information for an open classification. |

## Figma x Flutter Comparison

Widgetbook Cloud Review can also help with verifying if the developer meets the **design requirements** by comparing the **Flutter widgets** to their corresponding **Figma designs**.

### Guide

To have "View in Figma" button in your reviews, you need to add the Figma URL to your use-cases:

1. In your Figma design file, navigate to the component that resembles your Widget.
1. Copy the link to the component by right-mouse clicking on the component and selecting `Copy/Paste as` > `Copy Link`.
1. Set the `designLink` property of the `@UseCase` annotation by pasting the copied link.

   ```dart
   // Example from https://github.com/widgetbook/groceries-demo/blob/main/widgetbook/lib/core/app_bar.dart
   @UseCase(
     designLink: 'https://www.figma.com/file/EXuEpwiyksLAejYX1qr1v4/Fluttercon-Berlin-2023-Demo?type=design&node-id=277-3056&mode=design&t=nVL8hLmc1jlcilZL-4',
     name: 'Default',
     type: AppBar
   )
   ```

1. Re-run `build_runner` to update the use-cases metadata.

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

1. Commit your changes and push them to your repository; to create a new build.
