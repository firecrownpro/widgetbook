Widgetbook Cloud has two main features that can help you improve your development workflow:

1. **Hosting Widgetbook Builds**: You can share your Widgetbook builds with your team or the community by uploading them to Widgetbook Cloud.
2. **Zero-configuration UI Regression Detector**: Widgetbook Cloud automatically detects UI regressions in your Widgetbook builds by comparing builds across different branches or commits, and notifies you about the changes.
