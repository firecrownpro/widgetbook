# Widgetbook Cloud Hosting

When you create a new commit in Git, a new version of your code is created.
With _Widgetbook Builds_ developers make the new version of their local Widgetbook accessible for the whole team.
If set up with CI/CD, you can have a build for each commit, for each pull-request and for each branch.

## Pushing a new build

To create a Widgetbook Build, follow these steps inside your Widgetbook project:

1. Run `widgetbook_generator` to generate metadata about your use-cases and components

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

1. Build the Widgetbook for the web

   ```bash
   # Default target (i.e. `lib/main.dart`)
   flutter build web

   # Custom target
   flutter build web -t lib/main.widgetbook.dart
   ```

1. Install the [Widgetbook CLI](/widgetbook-cli/overview)

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
   ```

1. Get your **API key** from the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.

1. Push the build to Widgetbook Cloud

   ```bash
   widgetbook cloud build push --api-key PROJECT_API_KEY
   ```

<Info>
The `cloud push` command uses the following directories:

1. `build/web/` to create a `.zip` archive that will be uploaded to Widgetbook Cloud.
1. `.dart_tool/build/generated/[your_app_name]/` to send metadata, _about the generated use-cases_, that will be used for [Widgetbook Cloud Review](/widgetbook-cloud/reviews).

</Info>

## Pushing new builds with CI

To better integrate Widgetbook Cloud with your development workflow, it is recommended to use CI/CD to push a new build **on every push** of a new commit.

<Info>
The following workflows assume you have Widgetbook structured as a sub-package

```tree
your_app/
├── pubsepc.yaml
├── lib/
└── widgetbook/
    ├── pubsepc.yaml
    └── lib/
```

    1. Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` to your [GitHub repository's secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository). You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.

    1. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file in your repository under `.github/workflows/widgetbook-cloud-hosting.yml` with the following content:

        ```yaml
        name: Widgetbook Cloud Hosting
        on: push

        jobs:
          widgetbook-cloud-hosting:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Checkout
                uses: actions/checkout@v3

              - name: Setup flutter
                uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2

                  flutter pub get
                  # Add any other steps needed to make your
                  # app widgets available for Widgetbook

              - name: Build Widgetbook
                working-directory: widgetbook
                run: |
                  flutter pub get
                  dart run build_runner build -d
                  flutter build web -t lib/main.dart

              - name: Install Widgetbook CLI
                run: dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli

              - name: Push Widgetbook Build
                working-directory: widgetbook
                run: widgetbook cloud build push --api-key ${{ secrets.WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY }}
        ```

    1. Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` under `widgetbook_credentials` group in your [Codemagic project's environment variables](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-basic-configuration/configuring-environment-variables/#configuring-environment-variables). You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.

    1. Add the following workflow to your Codemagic `codemagic.yaml` file.

        ```yaml
        workflows:
          widgetbook-cloud-hosting:
            name: Widgetbook Cloud Hosting

            triggering:
              events:
                - push

            environment:
              flutter: stable
              groups:
                - widgetbook_credentials

            scripts:
