# Widgetbook Cloud Hosting

When you create a new commit in Git, a new version of your code is created.
With _Widgetbook Builds_ developers make the new version of their local Widgetbook accessible for the whole team.
If set up with CI/CD, you can have a build for each commit, for each pull-request and for each branch.

## Pushing a new build

To create a Widgetbook Build, follow these steps inside your Widgetbook project:

1. Run `widgetbook_generator` to generate metadata about your use-cases and components

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

1. Build the Widgetbook for the web

   ```bash
   # Default target (i.e. `lib/main.dart`)
   flutter build web

   # Custom target
   flutter build web -t lib/main.widgetbook.dart
   ```

1. Install the [Widgetbook CLI](/widgetbook-cli/overview)

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
   ```

1. Get your **API key** from the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**.

1. Push the build to Widgetbook Cloud

   ```bash
   widgetbook cloud build push --api-key PROJECT_API_KEY
   ```

## CI

To automate the process of pushing a new build to Widgetbook Cloud, you can use CI/CD.
