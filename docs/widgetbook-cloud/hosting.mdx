# Builds

When you create a new commit in Git, a new version of your code is created.
With Widgetbook builds developers make the new version of their local Widgetbook accessible for the whole team.
If set up with CI/CD, you can have a build for each commit, for each pull-request and for each branch.

## Build process

Widgetbook Cloud builds have to be uploaded based on a Flutter web build.
To create a Flutter web build, follow these steps:

1. Locate your Widgetbook project
1. Run the build runner by using `flutter pub run build_runner build -d`
1. Run `flutter build web -t widgetbook.dart`

## Publish a build

A Flutter web build of Widgetbook is published by using the [Widgetbook CLI](/widgetbook-cli/overview).
An API key is required to publish a build.
See [How to Create an API Key](/widgetbook-cloud/setup#How-to-Create-an-API-Key) for more information.

To publish a build, follow these steps:

1. Activate the CLI by running `flutter pub global activate widgetbook_cli`
1. Run `widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY`

Feel free to customize the `publish` command by reading into the [CLI arguments](/widgetbook-cli/overview#arguments).

<Info>
  Publishing builds with the CI/CD is recommended as the setup is less error
  prone and more autonomous. See [CI/CD Setup](/widgetbook-cloud/setup) for more
  information.
