# Configure GitHub Webhook

Setting up a GitHub Webhook allows Widgetbook Cloud to receive updates about changes in your repository. Widgetbook Cloud can automatically update the state of a Review to `closed` or `merged` when a corresponding Pull-Request is `closed` or `merged`. To enable this functionality, you need to configure a webhook. For detailed instructions, see [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook).

### Prerequisites

To set up a webhook for Widgetbook Cloud, you need the following:

- Webhook Secret
- Payload URL

### Retrieving the Webhook Secret

You can obtain the webhook secret by navigating to the project overview and clicking the `Get secret` button within the webhook card.

### Webhook Configuration

1. Visit https://github.com/user-name/repo-name/settings/hooks, replacing `user-name` and `repo-name` with your specific values.
2. Click `Add webhook`.
3. Paste `https://api.widgetbook.io/v1/webhooks/github` into the `Payload URL` field.
4. Set `Content type` to `application/json`.
5. Paste your Widgetbook Cloud webhook secret into the `Secret` field.
6. Choose when to trigger the webhook:
   1. Select `Send me everything`, or
   2. Select `Let me select individual events` and enable `Pull requests` and `Pushes`. You can disable all other options.
