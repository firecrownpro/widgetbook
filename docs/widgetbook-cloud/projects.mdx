# Projects

A project within Widgetbook Cloud encompasses all information related to the available Widgetbook versions, reviews, and use-cases. For each Widgetbook defined in your codebase, there should be a corresponding project in Widgetbook Cloud. Projects enable product owners to manage access to specific Widgetbooks.

## Create a Project

To create a new project, you need to create a company.
Then, follow the steps provided by the user interface to create a project.
