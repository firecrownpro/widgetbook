# Review (beta)

> **NOTE:** Since the Review feature is currently in beta, we're not aiming to migrate any data created previous to the official (non-beta) release to make changes to the feature easier for our development team.

The Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ feature (currently in beta) allows teams to review added, changed or removed components.
The Review feature closely relates to reviews known from Pull-Requests.
For each Pull-Request, our new `widgetbook` CLI analyzes the changes to your Widgetbook and creates a review.
Frontend team members can now review each _changed_ use-case in isolation and add comments for other team members.

### Review status definitions in the review process

- **Open:** Reviews awaiting assessment
- **Merged:** Reviews associated with merged PRs, hence, also considered as merged
- **Closed:** Reviews linked to closed PRs, therefore, also categorized as closed
- **Updating:** Reviews lacking essential information for classification as open. A review becomes eligible for review (open) when:

* There is an available head build AND
* A base build is present or at least one use-case is associated with a DesignLink.

Once all changes from the review are accepted, a developer closes the Pull-Request and the review's status gets updated to `merged`.
For this to work, a GitHub app integration is required.

## Requirements

To use Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ your setup has to meet the following requirements:

- Use [widgetbook_generator package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_generator) in version `{{ versions.generator }}` (no special configuration required).
- Use [widgetbook package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook) in version `{{ versions.widgetbook }}` (no special configuration required).
- Use the `widgetbook` CLI from the [widgetbook_cli package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_cli).
- Setup a GitHub app

# How the Review feature works

A Widgetbook Review allows Flutter teams to compare changes in the user interface.
Within the review, the team compares the current version with a previous version.
In addition, the review feature also offers to compare the current version of a Widget with the Figma design of a component.

The structure of a review has similarities to the pull request workflow.
In a pull request, developers compare a `base` branch (previous version) with a `feature` branch (new version) based on the lines of code changed.
For the review, our integration creates a Widgetbook Cloud review for each pull request in your Git provider.
Like how the previous code is compared to the current code on a line-by-line basis, Widgetbook Cloud teams compare a base build (last version) with a feature build (current version) on a visual use-case basis.
Therefore, Widgetbook Cloud requires an uploaded build for the base and feature branches.

## Builds for review

Use the [widgetbook_cli package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_cli) to upload a build for the base and feature branch.

<Tabs
  values={[
    { label: 'Upload base build', value: 'base' },
    { label: 'Upload feature build', value: 'feature' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="base">
    Define a CI/CD pipeline that uploads a build for each push to your base branch.
    The base branch is likely your `main`, `master`, `dev` or `staging` branch.

    ```bash title="CI/CD upload base build"
    # Install dependencies
    flutter pub get
    # Run the build runner
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    # Build the Widgetbook
    flutter build web -t lib/ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart
    # Install the CLI
    dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
    # Run the CLI
    widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="feature">
    Define a CI/CD pipeline that uploads a build for each push to your pull request.
    The feature branch can be any branch merged into your base branch.
    The base branch is likely your `main`, `master`, `dev` or `staging` branch.

    <Info>
        To successfully upload review information, you must define the `--base-branch` argument for the Widgetbook CLI.
    </Info>

    ```bash title="CI/CD upload feature build and review."
    # Install dependencies
    flutter pub get
    # Run the build runner
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    # Build the Widgetbook
    flutter build web -t lib/ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart
    # Install the CLI
    dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
    # Run the CLI
    widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY --base-branch BASE-BRANCH
    ```

    <Info>
        All CI/CD providers expose the `BASE-BRANCH` via environment variables for pull requests.
        Please have a look at our [CI/CD provider examples](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#examples).
    </Info>

## Review information

In addition to the required builds, a review has to be populated with information about which use cases changed.
The information on which use cases changed is extracted by the CLI when the `--base-branch` argument is specified.

<Info>
  Widgetbook Cloud shows Reviews for each pull-request. However, only Reviews that have changes to
  use cases are accessible.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Currently, Widgetbook Cloud only shows use cases that have been changed, added or removed within
  the feature branch in comparison to the base branch. That means, that already existing use cases
  will not be shown even if they have never been reviewed.
</Warning>
