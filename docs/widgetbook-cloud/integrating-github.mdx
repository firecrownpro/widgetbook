# Integrating GitHub App with Widgetbook Cloud

A GitHub App is a first-class actor on GitHub, meaning it has its own identity separate from users.
GitHub Apps can perform tasks such as sending messages or opening issues, and they can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They offer granular permissions, enhancing security by limiting access to only what's necessary.

To streamline your workflow and improve your overall efficiency, you can integrate GitHub App with Widgetbook Cloud.

## Step 3: Start GitHub App Installation Flow

Now, you're ready to start the GitHub App installation process. This process requires administrative permissions for the repository.
If you lack these permissions, you can still follow the flow but you'll request permission instead and the repo admin has to accept the request of "installing" the GitHub app.
