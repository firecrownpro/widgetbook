# Integrating GitHub App with Widgetbook Cloud

A GitHub App is a first-class actor on GitHub, meaning it has its own identity separate from users.
GitHub Apps can perform tasks such as sending messages or opening issues, and they can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They offer granular permissions, enhancing security by limiting access to only what's necessary.

To streamline your workflow and improve your overall efficiency, you can integrate GitHub App with Widgetbook Cloud.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to go about it:

## Step 1: Initiate via your Company Profile

First, navigate to your company's profile on Widgetbook Cloud. This can be done by selecting 'Company' from the navigation rail on your dashboard.
