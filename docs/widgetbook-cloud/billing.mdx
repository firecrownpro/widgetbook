# Billing (TO BE REWRITTEN ONCE WE ARE READY)

To create a project within Widgetbook Cloud, a billing account is necessary. Billing accounts should be created by project owners or team leads, as only they have the ability to create projects. Projects will be disabled if no subscription is available or if a subscription is canceled or postponed.

## Create a Billing Account

1. Select _Billing_ from the navigation rail on the left.
2. If your account is not associated with a billing account, the user interface will indicate this. If it is, the interface will display the current billing account.
3. Follow the user interface's instructions to create the billing account.

## Subscribing to a Plan

1. After creating a billing account, the user interface will present an option to subscribe to a Widgetbook Cloud plan.
2. Choose a plan to enable project creation, activation, and collaboration with other team members.
3. Follow the user interface instructions and proceed to Stripe for payment.
4. Upon successful payment, the subscribed plan will be displayed in the Widgetbook Cloud user interface within seconds.

## Managing a Plan's Subscription

1. The active plan will be shown in the user interface.
2. Click the button to view and manage the plan's details.
3. The application will redirect to the Stripe customer portal, where you can view recent payments and manage the subscription.

## Invoicing

All Widgetbook Cloud subscription plans are user-based. Each plan's billing account is invoiced for the number of _unique_ users, determined by their email addresses. A user is invoiced only once, even if they are a member of multiple projects under the same billing account.
