## How to Create an API Key

1. Log in to Widgetbook Cloud with your account.
2. API keys are tied to projects, so you need a project to obtain an API key.
3. Only users with the `Owner` role can fetch a project's API key to protect sensitive information.
4. If you are not a project owner but need the API key, ask your project owner to promote you from member to owner. For more information on member management, see [Member Management](/widgetbook-cloud/projects#member-management).
5. To create a new project, [create a billing account](/widgetbook-cloud/billing) first.
6. On the project's detail page, a card with a button to fetch the API key is displayed. Click the button to copy the API key to your clipboard.
