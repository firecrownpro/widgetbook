## How to create an API Key

1. Log in to Widgetbook Cloud with your account.
2. API keys are tied to projects, so you need a project to obtain an API key.
3. Only users with the `Owner` role can fetch a project's API key to protect sensitive information.
4. If you are not a project owner but need the API key, ask your project owner to promote you from member to owner. For more information on member management, see [Member Management](/widgetbook-cloud/projects#member-management).
5. To create a new project, [create a company](/widgetbook-cloud/setup#how-to-create-a-company) first.
6. On the project's detail page, a card with a button to fetch the API key is displayed. Click the button to copy the API key to your clipboard.

## How to connect our GitHub app

See our documentation regarding integrating [GitHub](/widgetbook-cloud/integrating-github).

## How to add workflows for CI/CD

For Widgetbook Cloud to work properly we recommend to create workflows for two different events:
1. When a new commit is published to the base branch (`main`, `staging` or whatever branch you like)
2. When a new pull request is opened and whenever the Git history changes for the pull-request

Due to specifics of each CI/CD vendor, we prepared the following examples for you:
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/widgetbook/groceries-demo/tree/staging/.github/workflows)
- [Codemagic](https://github.com/widgetbook/groceries-demo/blob/staging/codemagic.yaml)

Not finding your vendor? [Let us know via Discord](https://discord.gg/zT4AMStAJA). We are happy to assist you. 

### 1. New commit workflow

A general workflow for uploading a new version of your Widgetbook to Widgetbook Cloud looks like this:

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
# Run the build runner (Optional)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
# Build the Widgetbook
flutter build web -t lib/ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart
# Install the CLI
dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
# Execute the CLI
widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY
```

### 2. Pull request workflow

Whenever a pull-request is created or updated, Widgetbook Cloud requires information on what changed. 
Therefore, the CLI requires the `--base-branch` agrument to compare the current feature branch against the base branch. 
For this to fully work, the CLI also requires the `build_runner` outputs. 
Therefore, make sure that `build_runner` runs before the CLI even if you have committed all generated files. 

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
# !!! 
# !!! Run the build runner
# !!! This is mandatory even if you have commited the generated files since 
# !!! the generator creates files that are consumed by the Widgetbook CLI
# !!!
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
# Build the Widgetbook
flutter build web -t lib/ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart
# Install the CLI
dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
# Run the CLI
widgetbook publish --api-key API-KEY --base-branch main
```

## Workflow for the first review 

1. Create a new commit on your base branch containing a Widgetbook with at least one use case
2. Push the commit to your remote repository
3. Check if the workflow for new commits is triggered and succeeds
4. Check if you see a new Widgetbook Cloud build for the branch you pushed to
5. Make adjustments to one or multiple use cases
6. Create a new feature branch
7. Commit your changes
8. Push the commit and the new feature branch to your remote repository
9. Check if the workflow for new pull-requests is triggered and succeeds
10. Check if you see a new Widgetbook Cloud build for the new feature branch you pushed to
11. Check if you see a new open Widgetbook Cloud review
