# Telemetry

Widgetbook Generator collects and reports **anonymous** usage information.
This information is essential to figure out how we should improve our package.

## How to opt-out

To opt-out from telemetry:

1. Create a `build.yaml` file at the root of your project (next to your `pubspec.yaml`).
1. Add the following content to the file:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      $default:
        builders:
          widgetbook_generator:telemetry:
            enabled: false
    ```

## What we send

A new telemetry report is sent whenever there are any modifications to `*.directories.g.dart` files.
after you run the `build_runner build` command.

We send the following information:

1. The package name.
1. Unique **hashed** anonymous tracking ID based on your git config email.
1. Information about Widgetbook Components like:
    - The number of components.
    - The number of components with various counts of use-cases.
    - The packages' names where the components were defined.
