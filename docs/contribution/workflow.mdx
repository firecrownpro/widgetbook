# Contribution Workflow

Contributing to a project involves a series of steps to ensure the changes are
consistent with the existing codebase and the project's overall goals. Here's a
detailed walkthrough of the process:

## Preparation

### 1. Stay Updated

- Before starting any new work, ensure you have the latest updates from the main
  project.
- Synchronize your fork with the main repository. If you're unsure, refer to the
  section on [Synchronizing Your Fork](/contribution/sync-your-fork).

### 2. Create a Branch

- Always work on a new branch for every new feature or bug fix. This keeps your
  working directory clean and allows you to work on multiple features
  simultaneously.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
  ```

  _Tip:_ Use descriptive branch names. It helps in understanding the branch's
  purpose at a glance.

## Making Changes

### 1. Test Your Code

- Relevant tests should accompany every contribution. This ensures that your
  changes work as expected and don't introduce bugs.

  _Example:_ If you've added a new widget, create tests to verify its behavior
  under various conditions.

### 2. Implement Changes

- Write clean, well-commented code and adhere to the project's coding standards.
- If you're unsure about a particular approach, discuss it in the issue comments
  or the project's community channels.

### 3. Code Formatting

- Maintain a consistent coding style across the project using Dart's formatting
  tool.

  ```bash
  dart format -w .
  ```

### 4. Analyze Your Code

- Ensure that your code adheres to Dart's best practices and has no potential
  issues.

  ```bash
  dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings .
  ```

## Before Submission

### 1. Commit Properly

- Group-related changes into individual commits.
- Use clear and concise commit messages describing the changes.

  _Example:_ Instead of "fix bugs", use "fix null pointer exception in WidgetRenderer".

### 2. Documentation

- Enhance the documentation if you've introduced new features, made changes to
  the public API, or feel that a particular aspect of the project needs clearer
  instructions.

### 3. Testing

- Before submitting your changes, ensure all existing tests pass. Run:

  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```

### 4. Sign the CLA

- Before your changes can be merged, you need to sign the
  [Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuRfjUzENsLsmQgqZlGLxMKbFi7zuXoPARyXytoyQrq7ntUw/viewform).
  This is a standard procedure for open-source contributions to protect both the
  contributor and the project.

## Submitting Changes

### 1. PR Creation

- Push your branch to your fork and create a pull request (PR) against the main
  Widgetbook repository.

  _Tip:_ In the PR description, provide a detailed overview of the changes and
  their motivations, and if they're related to any existing issues, link those.

### 2. PR Conventions

- Adhere to the project's PR title and description conventions. If the project
  follows a specific format or template, ensure your PR respects that.

### 3. Verify CI Status

- After creating a PR, automated Continuous Integration (CI) checks will run.
  Ensure they all pass. If any checks fail, review and address the reported
  issues.
