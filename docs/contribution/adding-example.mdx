# Adding an Example

Examples serve as practical demonstrations of what can be achieved with the
project. Here's how to contribute an example:

1. **Directory Structure**: Save your example in the `examples` directory.
   Ensure the code is organized, well-documented, and easy to follow.
2. **Continuous Integration (CI) Checks**: Integrate necessary CI checks for
   your example. This ensures that as the main codebase evolves, your example
   remains functional. CI checks can include building, testing, and other
   validations.

3. **README**: Consider adding a README file within your example directory
   explaining what the example demonstrates, any special instructions, or other
   relevant information.
