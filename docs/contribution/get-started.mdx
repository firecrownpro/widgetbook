# Getting Started

Setting up your development environment correctly is crucial to ensure a smooth 
and consistent development experience when working on features or fixing bugs. 

Follow this step-by-step guide to get started with contributing to Widgetbook:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Before you make any changes, you'll need your copy
   of the Widgetbook repository. You can freely experiment without affecting the
   original project by forking the repository. To do this:

   - Visit the
     [Widgetbook repository](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook).
   - Click the "**Fork**" button at the top right of the repository page.
   - You'll now have your own fork of the repository under your GitHub account.

   _Tip:_ Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to stay updated with
   the latest changes. This helps in avoiding merge conflicts later on. Check
   out [Synchronize Your Fork](/contribution/sync-your-fork).

2. **Clone Your Fork:** With your fork ready, clone it to your local machine to
   start development. Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your actual GitHub
   username:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/widgetbook.git
   ```

   This command creates a local copy of your forked Widgetbook repository. You
   can navigate, make changes, and test them on this local copy.

3. **Install Melos:** `Melos` is a tool that streamlines working with
   mono-repositories (repositories containing multiple projects/packages).
   Widgetbook leverages `Melos` to efficiently manage its various packages:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate melos
   ```

   By activating Melos, you're setting yourself up to easily manage
   dependencies, run scripts, and more across all the packages in Widgetbook.

4. **Bootstrap the Repository:** Setting up the repository involves multiple
   steps, including installing dependencies, bootstrapping, and generating
   necessary files:

   - Navigate to the cloned repository:

     ```bash
     cd widgetbook
     ```

   - Fetch and install dependencies for the project:

     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

   - Using Melos, bootstrap the project. This step links inter-dependent
     packages in the repo, ensuring they work together seamlessly:

     ```bash
     melos bootstrap
     ```

   - Generate any necessary build files:

     ```bash
     melos generate
     ```

   _Note:_ If at any point you encounter issues, refer to Widgetbook's official
   documentation or seek help from the community on platforms like Discord or
   GitHub Discussions.

5. **Contribution Workflow**:Now that you're all set up, it's time to learn 
     how to submit a quality PR.Check out the  [Contribution Workflow](/contribution/workflow)
