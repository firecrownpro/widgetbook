# Ways to Contribute

Contributions to Widgetbook go beyond just code. We welcome a diverse 
range of contributions that can help the project flourish and benefit the 
community. 

Here are some impactful ways you can make a difference:

## 1. **Developing New Features**

Enhance the platform with new functionalities. This might involve introducing new
widgets, improving integration with other tools, or even revolutionizing how users 
interact with Widgetbook.

_Example:_ Introducing a "dark mode" for the Widgetbook interface.

## 2. **Fixing Bugs**

Identify and resolve issues, glitches, or problems within the existing codebase.
Your contributions help stabilize the platform and ensure a seamless experience for users.

   _Example:_ Resolving an issue where Widgetbook crashes when loading a specific type of widget.

## 3. **Increasing Test Coverage**

Write new tests or enhance existing ones. High test coverage ensures code stability 
and guards against regressions when making changes.

_Example:_ Adding tests to verify the behavior of newly introduced widgets under various scenarios.

## 4. **Improving Documentation**

Enhance the official documentation by writing, clarifying, or expanding content. Well-documented 
projects help both newcomers get started and experts delve deeper into the platform.

 _Example:_ Crafting a comprehensive guide on integrating Widgetbook with other popular Flutter tools.

## 5. **Providing Examples**

Share practical use-cases or scenarios as examples. These serve as starting points and offer 
clarity on applying specific features. Check out the [Adding Examples](/contribution/adding-example)
doc page for more details.

_Example:_ Creating an example demonstrating how to use Widgetbook for managing state in a complex Flutter app.

## Developing New Features

Building new features is an exciting endeavor. To align your efforts with the project's goals 
and vision, consider the following steps:

1. **Research First**

Start by exploring the [existing enhancement issues](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/labels/enhancement).
This will give you insights into what's already being considered and where you can contribute.
If you don't find your proposed feature, don't be discouraged.

 _Example:_ Suppose you want to add a "drag and drop" feature for widgets within Widgetbook. Check if there's an existing issue or discussion related to it.

2. **Propose Your Feature**

If your idea isn't already listed, [create a new issue](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/issues/new).
Clearly describe the feature, its benefits, potential challenges, and perhaps even outline
a roadmap or plan for how you envision building it.

 _Example:_ For the "drag and drop" feature, describe how it would enhance user workflows, mention any libraries or tools you plan to use, and provide potential UI/UX mockups.

3. **Express Your Intent**

Once you've created an issue or chosen an existing one to work on, leave a comment to
express your interest. This informs the community and maintainers that you're keen on
contributing to this feature, preventing duplicated efforts.

_Example:_ A simple comment like, "I'm interested in developing this feature and have some ideas. Any feedback or suggestions before I start?" can initiate collaboration.

4. **Alignment with Maintainers**

Before diving deep into coding, seek feedback from project maintainers. Their insights
will be invaluable in shaping the direction of your feature and ensuring it integrates
smoothly with the existing ecosystem.

_Example:_ After discussions, maintainers might suggest specific design patterns, libraries to use, or share potential pitfalls to be aware of.
