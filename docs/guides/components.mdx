# Components

Components in Figma might be resembled by one or multiple variants, which are
variations of a component.

<Info>Read what is a Component in [Terminology](/terminology) page.</Info>

In Flutter, the `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlineButton` are variants
of a _Button_ component. In addition, different Flutter states of a button (e.g.,
focused or hovered) might resemble in Figma as additional variants.

## Components Vs. Use-cases

Widgetbook features a **_component_** and **_use-case_** approach in which a
single component has one or multiple use-cases.

A use-case might resemble a variant of a component or just a specific state of
the component.

In Widgetbook, developers create a folder tree structure to organize and catalog
components.
