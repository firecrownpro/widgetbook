# Widgetbook Cloud x GitLab

If you want to use Widgetbook Cloud with your existing GitLab repository, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Widgetbook Cloud Project">
    Create a new project in Widgetbook Cloud by importing your GitLab repository.
    You might need to connect your GitLab account to Widgetbook Cloud to access your repositories.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add API Key as a Variable">
    Add `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` to your [GitLab's CI/CD Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#for-a-project). You can find the API key in the Widgetbook Cloud's **project settings page**. Make sure you **uncheck "Protect variable" checkbox**, to allow the variable to be accessible from feature branches.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create GitLab CI/CD Pipeline">
    To upload a [Widgetbook Build](/cloud/builds) for each new commit in your repository, you need to setup up a pipeline in GitLab CI/CD that runs on every push.

    Create a new GitLab pipeline file in your repository under `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    image: ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter

    stages:
      - widgetbook

    widgetbook_cloud_hosting:
      stage: widgetbook
      script:
        # Bootstrap App
        - flutter pub get
        - flutter gen-l10n
        # Bootstrap Widgetbook
        - cd widgetbook
        - flutter pub get
        - dart run build_runner build -d
        - flutter build web
        # Upload to Widgetbook Cloud
        - dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli
        - export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
        - widgetbook cloud build push --api-key "$WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY"
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a Merge Request">
    To test out if everything works properly, create a new branch and push a commit to it, then submit a MR with the new branch.
    After the build upload finishes, a commit status will be added to your MR once the [Widgetbook Review](/cloud/reviews) is ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

To make sure that your Widgetbook Cloud setup works properly, you can check that your repository has a Webhook configured _(under Project Settings > Webhooks)_ to notify Widgetbook Cloud about new MRs.
