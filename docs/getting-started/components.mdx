# Add Component

To understand better, let's review a few tips before you can add your first
component.

## Components

Components in Figma might be resembled by one or multiple variants, which are
variations of a component.

<Info>Read what is a Component in [Terminology](/terminology) page.</Info>

In Flutter, the `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlineButton` are variants
of a _Button_ component. In addition, different Flutter states of a button (e.g.,
focused or hovered) might resemble in Figma as additional variants.

## Components Vs. Use-cases

Widgetbook features a **_component_** and **_use-case_** approach in which a
single component has one or multiple use-cases.

A use-case might resemble a variant of a component or just a specific state of
the component.

In Widgetbook, developers create a folder tree structure to organize and catalog
components.

## Add your first component

Adding components to Widgetbook works differently based on your choice: manual
approach or generator approach

1. To add components in the generator approach, you can add use cases with `@UseCase` annotation.

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;

   @widgetbook.UseCase(
     name: 'with green color',
     type: Container,
   )
   Widget greenContainerUseCase(BuildContext context) {
     return Column(
       children: [
         Container(
           color: Colors.green,
           child: const SizedBox.square(
             dimension: 100,
           ),
         ),
       ],
     );
   }
   ```

2. The annotation is used on a use-case builder method with a return type of
   `Widget` and a single required parameter `BuildContext`.

   <Info>
     You can freely pick the name of the method, but make sure the name of a
     newly created use-case builder method does not have a name conflict with
     already existing methods.
   </Info>

3. In addition, `@UseCase` requires two mandatory parameters `type` and `name`
   that allow you to customize how the use-case is shown in the navigation of
   Widgetbook.

4. Execute the `build_runner` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```
