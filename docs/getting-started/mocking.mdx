# Optimizing Widget Dependencies

In Flutter, widgets are the cornerstone of any application. However, while
they're vital, they can often become tangled with dependencies, particularly as
your project scales. This guide seeks to address those complexities, focusing on
how to make your widgets more maintainable, especially within the context of
Widgetbook.

## Optimizing for Widgetbook

This guide explores how to optimize widget dependencies in Flutter for both
Widgetbook and easier unit testing. From basic examples to complex scenarios,
we'll delve into the process of decoupling widget logic for better
maintainability and scalability.

### 1. The Challenge with Direct Dependencies

While tools like Widgetbook facilitate widget cataloging and testing, a direct
dependency on data sources or business logic can pose challenges. When widgets
directly rely on data sources or logic, we encounter two primary issues:

1. **Widgetbook Cataloging:** Dependencies make widget cataloging a more tedious
   task.
2. **Testing Difficulties:** Directly linked logic makes unit tests less
   precise, as they often test more than one 'unit' at once. Also, it becomes
   harder to test.

#### 1.1 Basic Direct Dependency Example

Here's a widget dependent on a Bloc:

```dart
class ExampleWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExampleWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final name = context.read<ValueBloc>().name;
    return Text(name);
  }
}


@UseCase(name: 'default', type: ExampleWidget)
Widget exampleUseCase(BuildContext context) {
  return BlocProvider(
    create: (context) => ValueBloc(name: 'This is the name'),
    child: ExampleWidget(),
  );
}
```

In this widget, `ExampleWidget` reads data from `ValueBloc`. This hard-coded
dependency is what makes testing and cataloging problematic.

### 2. Separation of Concerns

To address the issues above, we can separate our concerns:

let the widget handle UI and presentation while an external entity deals with
data and logic.

### 2.1 Refactoring the Basic Example

Here’s how `ExampleWidget` can be redesigned to receive its data externally:

```dart
class ExampleWidgetRefactored extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExampleWidgetRefactored({super.key, required this.name});

  final String name;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(name);
  }
}

@UseCase(name: 'refactored', type: ExampleWidgetRefactored)
Widget exampleUseCase(BuildContext context) {
  return ExampleWidgetRefactored(name: 'This is the name');
}
```

This refactoring ensures the widget doesn't know where the data comes from—it
just presents what it receives. You can fetch data from a Bloc, an API, or even
hard-coded values. The widget remains untouched in all cases.

### 3. Mocking for Testability and Development

Separating concerns facilitates mocking. Mocking is the process of simulating
parts of the system to isolate what we're testing. For widgets, this means we
can check their behavior under various conditions without connecting to actual
data sources.

Mocking offers:

1. Speed: Tests run faster as they bypass the actual logic or data fetching.
2. Reliability: Tests aren't affected by external failures (e.g., an API being
   down).
3. Precision: We test exactly what we intend to, no more and no less.

### 3.1 Mocking the Basic Example

Given the refactored widget, you can easily mock the name to test the widget:

```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets('displays the passed name', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(ExampleWidgetRefactored(name: 'Test Name'));
    expect(find.text('Test Name'), findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```

This test checks if `ExampleWidgetRefactored` correctly displays a passed name.

### 4. Addressing Complex Scenarios

When developing applications, it's common to encounter widgets that are deeply
nested and have multiple dependencies. Such scenarios can complicate code
maintenance, scaling, and especially testing. In this section, we'll tackle a
complex scenario, dissect the challenges it presents, and refactor it to a more
maintainable and testable structure.

#### 4.1 Initial Nested Widget Scenario

Consider the following widget structure, which depicts a typical complex
scenario:

```dart
class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ChildWidgetA(),
        ChildWidgetB(),
      ],
    );
  }
}

class ChildWidgetA extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final dataA = context.read<DataBloc>().itemA;
    return Text(dataA);
  }
}

class ChildWidgetB extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final dataB = context.read<DataBloc>().itemB;
    return Text(dataB);
  }
}
```

Here's what's happening:

1. `ParentWidget` is a simple widget holding two children in a column.
2. `ChildWidgetA` fetches `itemA` from `DataBloc` to display it.
3. `ChildWidgetB` fetches `itemB` from `DataBloc` to display it.

##### Challenges

- **Tightly coupled with `DataBloc`**: Both `ChildWidgetA` and `ChildWidgetB`
  are directly dependent on `DataBloc`. This makes it hard to reuse these
  widgets in different contexts or with different data sources.
- **Reduced testability**: Testing these widgets individually becomes tricky
  since they're tightly coupled to a specific Bloc.

This interlinked structure is tough to manage and test.

#### 4.2 Refactoring Approach

To refactor, our goals are:

1. **Decoupling from DataBloc**: By passing data directly to widgets.
2. **Enhancing Testability**: By reducing direct dependencies, widgets become
   more unit-test-friendly.
3. **Increasing Reusability**: Decoupled widgets can be reused in various parts
   of the application with different data.

#### 4.3 Refactored Code

Here's the refactored structure:

```dart
class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String itemA;
  final String itemB;

  ParentWidget({
    required this.itemA,
    required this.itemB,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ChildWidgetA(data: itemA),
        ChildWidgetB(data: itemB),
      ],
    );
  }
}

class ChildWidgetA extends StatelessWidget {
  final String data;

  ChildWidgetA({required this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(data);
  }
}

class ChildWidgetB extends StatelessWidget {
  final String data;

  ChildWidgetB({required this.data});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(data);
  }
}
```

Let's see what is happening:

- **Decoupling from DataBloc**: `ChildWidgetA` and `ChildWidgetB` no longer
  fetch data directly from `DataBloc`. Instead, they accept the required data as
  a constructor parameter. This decoupling means they aren't tied to a specific
  data source.

- **Enhancing Testability**: Testing `ChildWidgetA` and `ChildWidgetB` becomes
  straightforward. You can pass mock data to them directly, making unit testing
  a breeze. No need to set up a mock `DataBloc` or navigate complex widget trees
  to test simple logic.

- **Increasing Reusability**: Both child widgets can now be reused with
  different data sources or even in entirely different applications. They just
  require the necessary data to be passed to them.

#### 4.4 Mocking and Testing the Refactored Widgets

Given that our widgets are now decoupled and accept data directly via
constructors, the testing process becomes straightforward. Here's how you can
test the refactored widgets:

```dart
void main() {
  group('ChildWidgetA Tests', () {
    testWidgets('displays the correct data', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // 1. Define the mock data
      final mockData = 'Mocked Data A';

      // 2. Build our widget with the mock data
      await tester.pumpWidget(ChildWidgetA(data: mockData));

      // 3. Check if the widget displays the mocked data
      expect(find.text(mockData), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });

  group('ChildWidgetB Tests', () {
    testWidgets('displays the correct data', (WidgetTester tester) async {
      // 1. Define the mock data
      final mockData = 'Mocked Data B';

      // 2. Build our widget with the mock data
      await tester.pumpWidget(ChildWidgetB(data: mockData));

      // 3. Check if the widget displays the mocked data
      expect(find.text(mockData), findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

**Explanation**:

- Define the Mock Data: We're creating simple string data for our mock. This
  emulates what the widget would typically receive in a real-world scenario.

- Building the Widget with Mock Data: We tell the widget tester to build our
  target widget and supply it with the mock data.

- Assertions: We simply check if our widget displays the text that matches our
  mock data.

These tests ensure that given some data, `ChildWidgetA` and `ChildWidgetB`
display it correctly. Due to the simplicity of these widgets, the tests are
pretty straightforward. If the widgets had more complex logic or behavior, we
would expand our tests to cover those aspects.

### Sum up

By addressing these complex scenarios in such a manner, we ensure that our
widget tree remains scalable, maintainable, and testable. Future changes or
additions to the application become easier to manage, and individual components
can be tested and reused with ease.
