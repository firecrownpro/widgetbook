# Knobs

Knobs allow developers to customize how users of Widgetbook interact with a use-case of a component.
Due to knobs, users of Widgetbook can change the parameters of a use-case to test different inputs and states.
Changing the parameters helps developers and designers to better understand the functionality of a component.

[Follow the documentation](/knobs/overview) to understand how to configure knobs.
