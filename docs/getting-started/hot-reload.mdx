# Hot Reload

# TODO

# Also: Hot reload is essential for our users. We often see the question: How to hot reload with the generator? Hot reload works properly, but more context is required (you need to wait for the generator to finish and then trigger the hot reload manually). Where shall we put this information? Does a dedicated page make sense?
