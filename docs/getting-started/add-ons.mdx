# Addons

Addons are an integral tool for developers in personalizing their experience
with Widgetbook, enabling them to modify how all components are exhibited within
the Widgetbook interface.

Through the strategic utilization of Addons, developers can integrate many
features, including but not limited to distinct themes, localization options,
device compatibility, and an array of additional functionalities.

This allows for enhanced control over the overall Widgetbook customization
process.

[Follow the documentation](/addons/overview) to understand how to configure
Addons.
