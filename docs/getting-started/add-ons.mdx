# Add-ons

Add-ons are an integral tool for developers in personalizing their experience with Widgetbook, enabling them to modify how all components are exhibited within the Widgetbook interface.
Through the strategic utilization of add-ons, developers can integrate many features, including but not limited to distinct themes, localization options, device compatibility, and an array of additional functionalities. This allows for enhanced control over the overall Widgetbook customization process.

[Follow the documentation](/add-ons/overview) to understand how to configure add-ons.
