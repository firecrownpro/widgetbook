# 1. Install

Welcome to Widgetbook! This guide will help you get started with integrating Widgetbook into your Flutter projects and streamline your widget management process.

## Configuration Approaches

There are two approaches to configure Widgetbook:

1- **Manual Approach**: This approach involves using the [widgetbook package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook) and manually maintaining the widget structure in Widgetbook to keep it in sync with your application.

2- **Generator Approach**: This approach utilizes the [widgetbook_generator package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_generator) in combination with the [widgetbook_annotation package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_annotation). It automatically configures the widget structure in Widgetbook based on the structure defined in your application, keeping Widgetbook in sync with your app.

<Info>
  We recommend using the Generator approach over the Manual approach, as it simplifies the
  maintenance of Widgetbook. Additionally, the Generator approach offers seamless integration with
  [Widgetbook Cloud](/widgetbook-cloud/overview), further enhancing the review and collaboration
  process.

With these approaches in mind, you can now begin integrating Widgetbook into your project and enjoy the benefits of streamlined widget management and collaboration.
