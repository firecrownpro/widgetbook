Welcome to Widgetbook! This guide will help you integrate Widgetbook into your Flutter projects and streamline your widget management process.

Make sure to depend on the Widgetbook packages.

There are two approaches to configuring Widgetbook:

1. **Manual Approach**: This approach involves using the [widgetbook package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook) and manually maintaining the widget structure in Widgetbook to keep it in sync with your application.

2. **Generator Approach**: This approach utilizes the [widgetbook_generator package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_generator) in combination with the [widgetbook_annotation package](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_annotation). It automatically configures the widget structure in Widgetbook based on the structure defined in your application, keeping Widgetbook in sync with your app.

<Info>
  We recommend using the Generator approach over the Manual approach, as it simplifies the
  maintenance of Widgetbook. Additionally, the Generator approach offers seamless integration with
  [Widgetbook Cloud](/widgetbook-cloud/overview), further enhancing the review and collaboration
  process.

  <TabItem value="generator">

    ```bash
    flutter pub add widgetbook_annotation widgetbook
    flutter pub add widgetbook_generator build_runner --dev
    ```

    This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  widgetbook_annotation: ^3.0.0-beta.7

dev_dependencies:
  widgetbook: ^3.0.0-beta.14
  widgetbook_generator: ^3.0.0-beta.11
  build_runner:
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual">

    ```bash
    flutter pub add widgetbook --dev
    ```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  widgetbook: ^3.0.0-beta.14
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

With these approaches in mind, you can now begin integrating Widgetbook into your project and enjoy the benefits of streamlined widget management and collaboration.
