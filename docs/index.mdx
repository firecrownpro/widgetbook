# Overview

Widgetbook is a Flutter package inspired by [Storybook.js](https://storybook.js.org/) that simplifies the process of cataloging widgets to create your own [design system](/glossary/design-system), and testing the widgets across various configurations, like different devices, languages and themes.

Widgetbook is [recommended by Google's Flutter team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g2KYjiPzzA) who features us as experts for design systems and designer/developer collaboration.

## The Problem

Developing user interfaces in Flutter applications often involves creating and managing numerous widgets. However, developers face several challenges in the process:

- **Keeping the overview of the design system is difficult** Setting up and maintaining the structure for a [design system](/glossary/design-system) that catalogs every widget is time-consuming. As it's not the core business of a Flutter team, it also distracts the developers from actual feature development.

- **UI flaws:** Testing widgets across multiple devices, themes, and settings is time-consuming and prone to errors. When changing existing widgets, it is difficult to detect all resulting UI changes to ensure that all changes look and feel as intended.

## The Solution: Widgetbook

- **Build your own design system:** Widgetbook's cataloging system helps maintain a cohesive look and feel across applications and platforms, promoting a unified user experience.

- **Build your widgets in isolation:** Implement widgets without needing to fuss with data, APIs, or business logic. Use Widgetbook's [Addons](/addons) and [Knobs](/knobs) to quickly test your widgets in all relevant configurations.
