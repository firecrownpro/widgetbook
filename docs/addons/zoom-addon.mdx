# Zoom Addon

The Zoom Addon is a Widgetbook utility designed for adding a zoom
use-case being previewed within the Workbench.

## Setup

Here's how to configure it:

<Warning>
  In case `ZoomAddon` is used with other addons, then it must be defined after
  both [`AlignmentAddon`](/addons/alignment-addon) and
  [`DeviceFrameAddon`](/addons/device-frame-addon)
</Warning>

```dart
ZoomAddon(initialZoom: 1.0),
```
