# Introduction to Addons

Addons in Widgetbook provide an expandable, customizable way to tweak your development
environment. With options to use pre-existing Addons or to forge your own, the
possibilities for tailoring your domain to your specific project needs are substantial.

<Info>
  This section provides a general overview of Addons. Each Addon exhibits unique
  characteristics; therefore, it is recommended to delve into the documentation of the
  specific Addon you are employing for your Widgetbook.

Here are the fundamental components of our Addon system:

- **Fields and Their Significance:**

Fields play a crucial role in our system, representing the data inputs used in the
settings panel. These predefined and reusable UI elements are used to structure and define
the behavior of your Addons. With the help of Fields, you can specify how your Addons
function and appear within your development environment.

- **Into Widgets:** Fields can morph into Widgets displayed in the settings panel. This
  transformation helps in visualizing the settings directly within the development
  environment.
- **Into JSON Maps:** Fields can convert into JSON representations. The
  [`WidgetbookCloudIntegration`](/widgetbook-cloud/overview) system can interpret this
  JSON-format data, making Fields instrumental in inter-system communication.

- **Creation of Custom Addons:** Creating custom Addons using fields is essential to our
  system. This process empowers developers to design Addons that cater to their unique
  requirements.

- **The Role of the `appBuilder` Function:** While the `appBuilder` function is still
  available for use, developers also have the flexibility to define their Addons to inject
  functionality directly into the Widget tree. This feature allows for customization of
  the previewing experience based on the project's needs.

- **Order of injection and its Effect:** The sequence in which Addons and their
  functionalities are injected into the Widgetbook is determined by their specification
  order. For example, if you specify
  `Widgetbook(Addons: [ThemeAddon(...), LocalizationAddon(...)])`, the Theme widget will
  be a parent to the Localizations widget. This order generally doesn't affect the preview
  significantly but can subtly alter how widgets are previewed.

These key aspects combine to make our Addon system versatile and highly customizable,
enabling you to tailor your Widgetbook environment to your specific project needs.

## Available Addons

Widgetbook comes equipped with a variety of ready-to-use Addons:

- [Theme Addon](/addons/theme-addon): Provides theming options.
  - [Material Theme Addon](/addons/theme-addon#material-theme-Addon)
  - [Cupertino Theme Addon](/addons/theme-addon#cupertino-theme-Addon)
  - [Custom Theme Addon](/addons/theme-addon#custom-theme-Addon)
- [Device Frame Addon](/addons/device-frame-addon): Facilitates previewing use-cases on
  specific device sizes.
- [Localization Addon](/addons/localization-addon): Enables testing across different
  locales.
- [Text Scale Addon](/addons/text-scale-addon): Supports varying text scales and aids in
  accessibility testing.
- [Alignment Addon](/addons/alignment-addon): Enables centering the use-case within 
  the workbench.

## Example using Generator approach

Below is a code snippet that encapsulates these concepts:

```dart
// lib/widgetbook.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_screenutil/flutter_screenutil.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook/widgetbook.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;
import 'package:widgetbook_core/widgetbook_core.dart';

import 'widgetbook.g.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const WidgetbookApp());
}

@widgetbook.App()
class WidgetbookApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const WidgetbookApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook.material(
      directories: directories,
      addons: [
        MaterialThemeAddon(
          themes: [
            WidgetbookTheme(
              name: 'Light',
              data: yourCustomLightTheme
            ),
            WidgetbookTheme(
              name: 'Dark',
              data: yourCustomTheme
            ),
          ],
        ),
        TextScaleAddon(
          scales: [1.0, 2.0],
        ),
        LocalizationAddon(
          locales: [
            const Locale('en', 'US'),
          ],
          localizationsDelegates: [
            DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
            DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
          ],
        ),
        DeviceFrameAddon(
          devices: [
            Devices.ios.iPhoneSE,
            Devices.ios.iPhone13,
          ],
        ),
      ],
      appBuilder: (context, child) {
        return ScreenUtilInit(
          designSize: const Size(375, 812),
          minTextAdapt: true,
          splitScreenMode: true,
          useInheritedMediaQuery: true,
          builder: (context, child) {
            return MaterialApp(
              debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
              home: child,
            );
          },
          child: child,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

The above example demonstrates how you can use different Addons such as
`MaterialThemeAddon`, `TextScaleAddon`, `LocalizationAddon`, and `DeviceFrameAddon` in
Widgetbook. It also shows how to customize the `appBuilder` function to inject the
ScreenUtilInit widget into the Widget tree. Our Addon system in Widgetbook is designed to
enhance flexibility, interoperability, and overall user experience. By understanding and
effectively utilizing this system, you can unlock new possibilities and efficiencies in
your development process.
