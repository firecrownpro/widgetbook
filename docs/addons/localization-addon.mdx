# Localization Addon

The Localization Addon in Widgetbook lets developers preview how widgets behave under
different localization settings. This becomes essential when developing applications for a
global audience, accommodating differences in language, text direction, and regional
conventions.

## Setup

Here's how to configure it:

### Step 1:

Define `Locales` The first step in setting up the Localization Addon is to specify the
Locale you want to support. In our case, we have chosen to use 'en-US' (English - United
States).

```dart
const Locale('en', 'US'),
```

If your application supports more locales, you can add more Locale objects to the list.

### Step 2:

Next, you will need to define the `LocalizationDelegates` that are available. These
delegates are used to fetch locale-specific strings and other values.

```dart
localizationsDelegates: [
    DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
],
```

In this example, we have used two localization delegates provided by Flutter -
`DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate` and `DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate`.

### Step 3:

The final step is to construct the Localization Addon using the `LocalizationAddon` class.
This class takes in the locales and `localizationsDelegates` you specified earlier.

```dart
LocalizationAddon(
    locales: [
        const Locale('en', 'US'),
    ],
    localizationsDelegates: [
        DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    ],
    initialLocale: const Locale('en', 'US')
),
```

**Optional:** the `initialLocale` is optional is always read the first value of locales if
it is not defined.

This setup lets you preview widgets as they appear with the 'en-US' locale. The
Localization Addon is an excellent tool for ensuring that your application provides an
appropriate user experience across various locales.
