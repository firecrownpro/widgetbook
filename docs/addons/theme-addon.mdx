# Theme Addon

The Theme Addon lets you preview your use-cases in different themes. This ensures that
your components maintain their look and feel, consistent with the design language of your
application.

```dart
ThemeAddon<AppThemeData>(
  themes: [
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Light',
      data: yourCustomLightTheme,
    ),
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Dark',
      data: yourCustomDarkTheme,
    ),
  ],
  themeBuilder: (context, theme, child) {
    return AppTheme(
      data: theme,
      child: child,
    );
  },
)
```

`ThemeAddon` comes with two variants (`MaterialThemeAddon` and `CupertinoThemeAddon`),
that can be used as follows:

## Material Theme Addon

The Material Theme Addon lets you apply your `Material` themes, based on the `ThemeData`
class, to the components you're previewing. The `MaterialThemeAddon` class requires a
`themes` property, which lists the available themes.

An optional property `initialTheme` can be defined to specify which theme should be active
when the application starts. Here's an example of how you can use the Material Theme
Addon.

Here's an example of how you can use the Material Theme Addon:

```dart
MaterialThemeAddon(
  themes: [
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Light',
      data: yourMaterialLightTheme,
    ),
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Dark',
      data: yourMaterialDarkTheme,
    ),
  ],
  initialTheme: WidgetbookTheme(
    name: 'Light',
    data: yourMaterialLightTheme,
  ),
),
```

In this example, we have defined two themes: 'Light' and 'Dark'. The `name` property is a
user-friendly name that will be displayed in the Widgetbook user interface. The `data`
property corresponds to the actual `ThemeData` for each theme. The 'Light' theme is the
initial theme when the application starts.

Once you've set up your themes in this way, Widgetbook will provide an interface to switch
between these themes, allowing you to preview how your components will look under
different themes quickly.

## Cupertino Theme Addon

The Cupertino Theme Addon enables you to implement your Cupertino themes based on the
`CupertinoThemeData` class.

The `CupertinoThemeAddon` class necessitates a themes property to enumerate the available
themes. Additionally, an `initialTheme` can be specified to set which theme should be
active at the application's start.

Here's an example:

```dart title="Example: CupertinoThemeAddon"
CupertinoThemeAddon(
  themes: [
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Light',
      data: yourCupertinoLightTheme,
    ),
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Dark',
      data: yourCupertinoDarkTheme,
    ),
  ],
  initialTheme: WidgetbookTheme(
    name: 'Light',
    data: yourCupertinoLightTheme,
  ),
),
```

In this scenario, two themes: 'Light' and 'Dark', are defined. The name property is a
human-readable name displayed in the Widgetbook user interface.

The data property corresponds to the actual `CupertinoThemeData` for each theme. 'Light'
is selected as the initial theme when the application launches.

## Custom Theme Addon

Widgetbook also supports defining entirely custom themes in addition to Material and
Cupertino themes.

Assume you have defined a very simple custom theme `AppThemeData` that includes just a
single color.

<Info>
  The `AppThemeData` class can be compared with the `ThemeData` class for the Material
  design system or the `CupertinoThemeData` class for the Cupertino design system.
</Info>

```dart title="Example: AppThemeData"
class AppThemeData {
  final Color color;

  AppThemeData({
    required this.color,
  });
}
```

This `AppThemeData` object must now be injected into the Widget tree, which is typically
accomplished using an `InheritedWidget`. For instance, you could define an AppTheme
`InheritedWidget` to inject your custom theme into the Widget tree.

<Info>
  The `AppTheme` widget can be compared with the `Theme` Widget for the Material design
  system or the `CupertinoTheme` Widget for the Cupertino design system.
</Info>

```dart title="Example: AppTheme InheritedWidget"
class AppTheme extends InheritedWidget {
  const AppTheme({
    Key? key,
    required this.data,
    required Widget child,
  }) : super(
          key: key,
          child: child,
        );

  final AppThemeData data;

  static AppThemeData of(BuildContext context) {
    final widget = context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<AppTheme>();
    return widget!.data;
  }

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(covariant AppTheme oldWidget) {
    return data != oldWidget.data;
  }
}
```

Moreover, we define two custom theme instances:

```dart title="Example: Custom themes"
final blueTheme = AppThemeData(
  color: Colors.blue,
);

final yellowTheme = AppThemeData(
  color: Colors.yellow,
);
```

The `CustomThemeAddon` requires two properties. The `themes` property defines which themes
are available while the `initialTheme` property defines which theme is active and
selected.

```dart title="Example: CustomThemeAddon"
final themeAddon = CustomThemeAddon<AppThemeData>(
  themes: [
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Blue',
      data: blueTheme,
    ),
    WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Yellow',
      data: yellowTheme,
    ),
  ],
  initialTheme: WidgetbookTheme(
      name: 'Blue',
      data: blueTheme,
  ),
  themeBuilder: (context, AppThemeData theme, child){
    // your custom builder
    return Theme(
      data: theme,
      child: child,
    );
   }
);

```
