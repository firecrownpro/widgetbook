# Inspector Addon

The Inspector Addon is a Widgetbook utility designed to provide inspection 
capabilities for widgets. It allows developers to inspect various properties of a widget, 
such as colors, sizes, and padding, directly within the Widgetbook's Workbench.

## Setup
Here's how to configure it:

<Warning>
  If `InspectorAddon` is used alongside other addons, ensure it's defined appropriately in the addons list. 
  For instance, if used with the [`DeviceFrameAddon`](/addons/device-frame-addon), 
  ensure the order is correct based on your needs.
</Warning>
```dart
InspectorAddon(enabled: true),
```
