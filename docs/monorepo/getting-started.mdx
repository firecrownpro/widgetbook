# Efficiently Using Widgetbook in a Monorepo Setting

In the diverse Flutter ecosystem, it's commonplace for projects to segregate
their UI components into distinct packages. Although these UI component packages
are pivotal, they seldom form a standalone desktop application. A common hurdle
for developers arises when wanting to leverage Widgetbook for these packages.

This document shows a streamlined approach to seamlessly integrate Widgetbook
within a monorepo structure. The doc considers a tool-agnostic approach where
you can take any part of it and integrate it into your monorepo structure and
use any tool that you are comfortable with.

## A Primer on Monorepo Structure

To commence, we present an elementary monorepo framework for a Flutter project
which can serve as a foundation.

### 1. Unpacking the Monorepo Blueprint

Here's an ideal monorepo configuration tailored for Widgetbook:

- **apps**: Houses independent applications.
- **packages**: Stores shared Dart/Flutter modules.
- **widgetbook**: Incorporates the Widgetbook configurations and previews.

```bash
monorepo_example/
  apps/
    main_app/
    admin_app/
  packages/
    shared_ui/
  widgetbook/
```

An alternative structure situates the `widgetbook` within the `apps`
directory. This organization depends on the developer's preference.

However, isolating `widgetbook` from apps implies its unique purpose
â€” a platform designed exclusively to refine UI development.

### 2. Orchestrating Dependencies

Every package or application's `pubspec.yaml` should specify dependencies, which
allows referencing between packages.

For instance, within `main_app`, `widgetbook`, or `admin_app`, the
`shared_ui` can be referenced as:

```yaml
dependencies:
  shared_ui:
    path: ../../packages/shared_ui
```

For clarity, the complete `pubspec.yaml` of the `widgetbook` directory is
illustrated below:

```yaml
name: widgetbook_workspace # cannot be named just "widgetbook"
description: A playground to streamline shared_ui with Widgetbook
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev
version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  sdk: ">=3.1.0 <4.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shared_ui:
    path: ../packages/shared_ui

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

This configuration facilitates the sharing of `shared_ui` across multiple
projects, optimizing it further with Widgetbook during the development phase.

### 3. Creating a Widget

For a hands-on experience, let's formulate a custom button within `shared_ui`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  const CustomButton({
    super.key,
    required this.text,
    required this.onPressed,
    this.color = Colors.blue,
    this.textColor = Colors.white,
    this.borderRadius = 8.0,
  });

  final String text;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
  final Color color;
  final Color textColor;
  final double borderRadius;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
        foregroundColor: textColor,
        backgroundColor: color,
        shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(borderRadius),
        ),
      ),
      onPressed: onPressed,
      child: Text(text),
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. Configuring Widgetbook

Within the `widgetbook` directory, update the `pubspec.yaml` to
include the requisite `dependency` and `dev_dependencies`, ensuring you
incorporate `shared_ui`:

```bash
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  widgetbook_annotation: ^{{ versions.annotation }}
  widgetbook: ^{{ versions.widgetbook }}
  shared_ui:
    path: ../../packages/shared_ui

dev_dependencies:
  widgetbook_generator: ^{{ versions.generator }}
  build_runner:
```

### 5. Showcasing Widget Previews

Go into `widgetbook/lib` to commence drafting use cases and embarking
on other widgetbook-focused assignments.

For our earlier defined `CustomButton` within the `shared_ui` library, we can
craft two distinct use cases:

```dart

// lib/custom_button.dart <- File name

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;
import 'package:shared_ui/shared_ui.dart';

@widgetbook.UseCase(
  name: 'with green color',
  type: CustomButton,
)
Widget greenContainerUseCase(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    child: CustomButton(
      text: 'Text',
      onPressed: () {},
      color: Colors.green,
    ),
  );
}

@widgetbook.UseCase(
  name: 'with red color',
  type: CustomButton,
)
Widget redContainerUseCase(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    child: CustomButton(
      text: 'Text',
      onPressed: () {},
      color: Colors.red,
    ),
  );
}
```

To render your widgets, create an app within the `main.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook/widgetbook.dart';
import 'package:widgetbook_annotation/widgetbook_annotation.dart' as widgetbook;
import 'main.directories.g.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const WidgetbookApp());
}

@widgetbook.App()
class WidgetbookApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const WidgetbookApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook.material(
      // Use the generated directories variable
      directories: directories,
      addons: [],
    );
  }
}
```

### 6. Launching Widgetbook

Navigate to the `widgetbook` directory and run:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

This command initiates the generator in real-time. Subsequently, execute:

```bash
flutter run
```

Awesome, this was just the beginning, now you can start building upon this
approach.
