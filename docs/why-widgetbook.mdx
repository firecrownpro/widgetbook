# Why Widgetbook

Coming from a JavaScript background, our team used Storybook.js for years to build their React components in isolation, and cataloguing them in a consistent design system. However, when we switched to Flutter, there was no compelling Storybook solution. That's why we decided to build Widgetbook.

## The Problem

Developing user interfaces in Flutter applications often involves creating and managing numerous widgets. However, developers face several challenges in the process:

- **Keeping the overview of the design system is difficult** Setting up and maintaining the structure for a [design system](/design-system) that catalogs every widget is time-consuming. As it's not the core business of a Flutter team, it also distracts the developers from actual feature development.

- **UI flaws:** Testing widgets across multiple devices, themes, and settings is time-consuming and prone to errors. When changing existing widgets, it is difficult to detect all resulting UI changes to ensure that all changes look and feel as intended.

- **Tracking visual changes is hard:** When changing existing components or screens, it is difficult to detect all resulting UI changes to ensure that all changes look and feel as intended. [Golden Tests](/golden-tests) can help but they are often flaky and developers need to write them manually which takes time.

- **Misalignment between design and developmnent:** UI reviews are unstructured. Designers, developers, and other stakeholders often struggle to communicate effectively leading to misunderstandings and design inconsistencies.

## The Solution: Widgetbook

Widgetbook addresses these challenges by providing an open source Storybook for Flutter as well as Widgetbook Cloud. We've been featured as experts for design systems and designer/developer collaboration by Google's Flutter team.

- **Build your widgets in isolation:** Implement widgets without needing to fuss with data, APIs, or business logic. Use Widgetbook's [Addons](/addons/overview) and [Knobs](/knobs/overview) to quickly test your widgets in all relevant configurations.

- **Automated Golden Tests:** Widgetbook Cloud automatically detects all visual changes of your PR. Every widget can automatically be tested in different configurations, like themes or locales.

- **Alignment between design and code:** Widgetbook Cloud shortens the feedback loop of UI reviews between designers, developers, product managers and QA testers. Every changed widget of a PR is presented in a side by side comparison to its original Figma design, so that it can be quickly and accurately reviewed.
