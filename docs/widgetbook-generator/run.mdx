# Run the generator

## Generate the widgetbook

The `widgetbook_generator` uses [package:build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) to generate the desired code.

You can execute the generator by running `flutter pub run build_runner build`.
If you are making a lot of changes while developing, you can also run `flutter pub run build_runner watch` so [package:build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) will listen for changes in the file system and update Widgetbook accordingly.

## Start the generated app

The generator will create the `ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart` file in the same directory as the file in which `@WidgetbookApp` is used. For details about this, see the documentation of [package:widgetbook_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/widgetbook_annotation).

Start the app by running `flutter run -t lib/ui_catalogs.widgetbook.dart -d macos`.
