<Accordion title="I'm facing a Socket issue with NetworkImage and Image.network() in Widgetbook, though it works fine in emulators/simulators. Did I miss a specific configuration?">
	It sounds like you're running Widgetbook locally on MacOS. On MacOS, you need
	to grant network access in the XCode project settings. [Refer to this link for
	more
	details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65458903/socketexception-connection-failed-os-error-operation-not-permitted-errno-1.).

<Accordion title="How to set a initial page route?">
	Initial routes can be used to pick the home page that is used on first launch
	as follows: `Widgetbook( initialRoute: '?path=foo-bar', // ... )`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I align the `scaffoldBackgroundColor` with my custom dark and light themes in Widgetbook?">
	When referencing the scaffold's background, it's typically about the
	background of the preview screen/app, which Widgetbook renders using a
	Material Scaffold defined by the `ScaffoldBuildFunction`. For custom themes,
	the default Material Scaffold might not be suitable. To rectify this, you
	should integrate the custom theme with the scaffold. Check out [Custom Theme
	in Widgetbook](/cookbook/custom-theme). Using the provided context, you can
	access the prevailing Brightness and/or Theme. It's worth noting that current
	documentation might be limited regarding custom theming, but improvements are
	underway.
